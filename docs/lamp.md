# Lamp Module (`pinout/lamp`)

The **Lamp** module (`pinout/lamp`, device class `actuator.lamp`) provides commissioned, semantic control and status observation for illumination and indicator hardware (such as reference LEDs, signal lamps, or solid-state relays) over the verified ESP32 path, Modbus/MQTT adapters, or in-process simulation.

## Product Promise: Semantic Abstraction

An AI agent or autonomous operator interacting through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) or Pinout SDK sees **only semantic tool interfaces**:
- `lamp.arm`
- `lamp.disarm`
- `lamp.on`
- `lamp.off`
- `lamp.set`
- `lamp.status` (and generic `status.read`)

The agent **never sees or manipulates GPIO pin numbers, electrical logic levels, or bus wiring**. All physical electrical details are declared in deployment configuration (`devices.json`) and verified by host safety rules before actuation is permitted.

---

## Explicit Arming & Host-Loss Watchdog

Pinout operates on a strict **fail-closed, explicit-arming model**:

1. **Disarmed at Boot & Reconnect**: Upon initialization, boot, transport reconnection, or reset, the device starts in the `disarmed` state. No physical actuation occurs implicitly.
2. **First Action is Explicit Arming (`lamp.arm`)**: An agent or operator must explicitly call `lamp.arm` (optionally configuring `timeoutMs`) before issuing any actuation commands (`lamp.on`, `lamp.off`, `lamp.set`). Calling actuation commands while `disarmed` is immediately rejected with error code `NOT_ARMED`.
3. **Continuous Deadman Heartbeat**: When armed, a deadman watchdog counts down. If host communication ceases, the device locally trips to its declared safe level and enters the `tripped` state.
4. **No Automatic Resumption After Trip**: Following a watchdog trip or link fault, commands are rejected with `WATCHDOG_TRIPPED`. The **only** way back to `armed` is an explicit `lamp.arm` call.
5. **Explicit Disarm (`lamp.disarm`)**: When finished or in safe shutdown, `lamp.disarm` stops the watchdog timer and immediately applies the commissioned fail-safe electrical level.
6. **`autoArm` Configuration Flag**: `autoArm` defaults to `false`. If explicitly set to `true` in deployment configuration, it is treated strictly as an opt-in for automated tests or legacy demos and logs a runtime safety warning.

## Generic Evidence Contract & Multi-Stage State

The lamp module implements Pinout's canonical physical evidence contract defined in [docs/state-evidence.md](state-evidence.md).

A fundamental safety principle in Pinout is: **"Do not infer physical success from a successful write."**

A successful write to an ESP32 GPIO pin only proves that the host command reached the microcontroller and was acknowledged. It does not prove that current flowed, that a bulb illuminated, or that wiring is intact.

To make this distinction explicit and machine-verifiable, `lamp.status` returns:

```json
{
  "commanded": {
    "value": true,
    "on": true,
    "at": "2026-09-05T17:18:19.515Z",
    "source": "commanded"
  },
  "acknowledged": {
    "value": true,
    "on": true,
    "at": "2026-09-05T17:18:19.516Z",
    "source": "acknowledged"
  },
  "observed": {
    "value": null,
    "on": null,
    "at": null,
    "source": "none"
  },
  "freshnessMs": null,
  "stale": false,

  "evidence": {
    "on": {
      "commanded": { "value": true, "at": "2026-09-05T17:18:19.515Z", "source": "commanded" },
      "acknowledged": { "value": true, "at": "2026-09-05T17:18:19.516Z", "source": "acknowledged" },
      "observed": { "value": null, "at": null, "source": "none" },
      "freshnessMs": null,
      "stale": false,
      "provenance": "simulated"
    },
    "armed": {
      "commanded": { "value": null, "at": null, "source": "none" },
      "acknowledged": { "value": "armed", "at": "2026-09-05T17:18:19.000Z", "source": "acknowledged" },
      "observed": { "value": null, "at": null, "source": "none" },
      "freshnessMs": null,
      "stale": false,
      "provenance": "simulated"
    }
  }
}
```

### Evidence Levels

| Field | Meaning | What It Proves | What It Does NOT Prove |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `commanded` | The target state requested by host software. | Host intent. | Does not prove the command reached the device. |
| `acknowledged` | The command was received and acknowledged by the firmware (`gpio.write` ACK). | Host-device link communication and firmware pin driver write. | Does **not** prove the physical lamp produced photons or that the circuit is intact. |
| `observed` | Independent physical observation (e.g. from a photodiode, current sensor, or optical readback pin on `readbackPin`). | Independent electrical or optical sensor feedback. | `observed.on` remains `null` with `source: 'none'` unless an independent readback sensor is configured. |
| `freshnessMs` | Elapsed milliseconds since the last `observed` sample. | Temporal validity of observation. | |
| `stale` | True when `freshnessMs > observationMaxAgeMs`. | Indicates observed reading is too old for safe reliance. | |
| `provenance` | `'simulated'`, `'hardware'`, or `'unknown'`. | Explicit simulation origin vs real hardware. | Prevents agents from confusing simulated environments with physical hardware. |
| `armed` | `'armed'`, `'disarmed'`, `'tripped'`, or `'unknown'`. | Deadman watchdog and arming gate status. | |

### State Prerequisites

When `requireFreshObservation: true` is configured alongside `readbackPin`, `DeviceInstance` enforces a strict physical precondition on actuation commands (`lamp.on`, `lamp.set`):
- If `observed.value` is missing or `source === 'none'`, the invocation is rejected with `PREREQUISITE_MISSING`.
- If `observed.at` is older than `observationMaxAgeMs`, the invocation is rejected with `PREREQUISITE_STALE`.

See [docs/state-evidence.md](state-evidence.md) for full details on prerequisite enforcement and freshness decay.

## Deployment Configuration & Wiring

Wiring is specified in deployment configuration (`devices.json`), not in code.

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "devices": [
    {
      "id": "lamp-01",
      "module": "pinout/lamp",
      "label": "Inspection Station Illumination",
      "backend": {
        "type": "protocol",
        "transport": {
          "type": "serial",
          "path": "/dev/cu.usbserial-0001",
          "baud": 115200
        }
      },
      "config": {
        "pin": 2,
        "polarity": "active-high",
        "safeLevel": "low",
        "maxOnMs": 30000,
        "readbackPin": 13,
        "readbackPolarity": "active-high",
        "observationMaxAgeMs": 5000,
        "requireFreshObservation": false
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Configuration Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `pin` | integer | Yes | ESP32 GPIO pin connected to the lamp driver circuit. Must be a valid writable pin. |
| `polarity` | `'active-high' \| 'active-low'` | Yes | Electrical load polarity. `active-high`: driven HIGH to energize; `active-low`: driven LOW to energize (sink current). |
| `safeLevel` | `'low' \| 'high' \| 'high-z' \| 'hold'` | Optional | Fail-safe electrical state applied on watchdog expiry, disarm, or halt. Defaults to the de-energized level matching `polarity`. |
| `readbackPin` | integer | Optional | GPIO pin connected to an independent physical feedback sensor (e.g., photo-transistor or current monitor). |
| `readbackPolarity` | `'active-high' \| 'active-low'` | Optional | Polarity for the readback sensor. Defaults to `'active-high'`. |
| `maxOnMs` | number | Optional | Maximum continuous on-time in milliseconds. If exceeded, the lamp automatically turns off. |
| `observationMaxAgeMs` | number | Optional | Maximum acceptable observation age before state is deemed stale (defaults to 5000 ms). |
| `requireFreshObservation` | boolean | Optional | When true, enforces fresh observation prerequisites before allowing `lamp.on`/`lamp.set`. |
| `requireWatchdog`| boolean | Optional | Enforces that firmware must support host-loss deadman watchdog. Defaults to `true`. |
| `watchdogTimeoutMs` | number | Optional | Negotiated watchdog timeout interval. |
| `autoArm` | boolean | Optional | Whether to automatically arm upon initialization (defaults to `false`; demo/test opt-in only). |

### Polarity & Fail-Safe Inversion Rules

Safe-state configuration must guarantee de-energization during faults:
1. **Active-High Load (`polarity: "active-high"`)**:
   - De-energized electrical level is `LOW` (0 V).
   - Safe level must be `'low'` (or `'high-z'`).
   - A configuration with `safeLevel: "high"` is **REJECTED** with `UNSUPPORTED_CONFIGURATION` because safe state would dangerously energize the lamp.
2. **Active-Low Load (`polarity: "active-low"`)**:
   - De-energized electrical level is `HIGH` (3.3 V).
   - Safe level must be `'high'` (or `'high-z'`).
   - A configuration with `safeLevel: "low"` is **REJECTED** with `UNSUPPORTED_CONFIGURATION` because safe state would dangerously energize the lamp.

### Commissioning Guarantee

Before any actuation write occurs, the lamp backend commissions the pin safe state directly onto the device firmware via `gpio.configSafeState`. If host communication is severed or the host process crashes, the firmware locally enforces the configured safe level within the watchdog deadline without host intervention.

## Building Another Lamp Backend

Pinout provides a shared, backend-agnostic conformance suite: `runLampConformance`. Any lamp backend (e.g., Modbus, MQTT, or direct driver) must implement the `LampBackendLike` contract:

```typescript
import type { DeviceBackend, EvidenceState } from '@pinout/core';

export interface LampBackendLike extends DeviceBackend {
  /** Optional hook to simulate a watchdog trip or circuit trip in testing */
  injectTrip?(reason?: string): void;
  /** Optional hook to simulate independent readback sensor feedback */
  setSimulatedReadbackLevel?(level: boolean): void;
}
```

### Running the Conformance Suite

```typescript
import { runLampConformance } from '@pinout/core';

const result = await runLampConformance(async () => {
  return createMyCustomLampBackend({ ... });
});

console.log(result.passed ? 'ALL CHECKS PASSED' : 'CONFORMANCE FAILED');
for (const check of result.checks) {
  console.log(`- [${check.status.toUpperCase()}] ${check.name}`);
}
```

### Conformance Checks Performed

1. `active-low safe level validation`: Configuration where safe level energizes the load is rejected with `UNSUPPORTED_CONFIGURATION`.
2. `disarmed at start`: Backend initializes in `disarmed` state.
3. `actuation rejected before arm`: `lamp.on` thrown with `NOT_ARMED` while disarmed.
4. `explicit arm`: `lamp.arm` transitions state to `armed`.
5. `turn lamp on`: `lamp.on` energizes output and returns `{ on: true }`.
6. `status evidence model after write`: `commanded` and `acknowledged` reflect target on-state; `observed` remains `source: 'none'` unless independent readback is enabled.
7. `turn lamp off`: `lamp.off` de-energizes output and updates status.
8. `disarm and safe state enforcement`: `lamp.disarm` disarms and applies safe state; subsequent actuations are rejected.
9. `trip recovery and re-arm`: Watchdog trip transitions to `tripped` and blocks actuation until `lamp.arm` is called.
10. `honest provenance declaration`: Returns `'simulated'` or `'hardware'`.
11. `generic evidence contract getOperationalStateEvidence`: Returns `{ on, armed }` containing valid `EvidenceState` structures.
