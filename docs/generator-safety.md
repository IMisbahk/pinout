# Generator Safety

Pinout Generate produces **candidate** modules from documentation. Those candidates are **untrusted** until a human verifies them against real hardware.

## Core principles

1. **Generated code is untrusted.** Treat every generated backend, policy, and simulator as provisional source material — not production firmware drivers.
2. **Generated constraints may be incomplete.** Missing documentation yields `NO SAFE RANGE FOUND` and explicit uncertainties — not invented limits.
3. **Conformance ≠ physical certification.** `pinout module test` checks manifest structure, schemas, policy references, and simulator lifecycle. It does **not** prove safe behavior on a machine.
4. **Human review is required.** Every generated module includes `GENERATION_REPORT.md` with review checklists and `PINOUT_REVIEW_REQUIRED` markers in code where behavior is uncertain.
5. **Hardware testing is separate.** Connecting to physical devices requires explicit `pinout module install`, device registration, and operator configuration. Generation never auto-connects.

## Safety generation rules

| Source material | Generator behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Explicit documented range (e.g. "10°C to 80°C") | Hard policy with high confidence |
| Inferred limit (e.g. "max 80°C" without full range) | `candidate` constraint with `requiresHumanReview: true` — **not** promoted to hard policy |
| Missing limit | Uncertainty recorded; **no invented bound** |
| Conflicting documentation | Critical uncertainty; no silent merge |

Low-confidence capabilities (< 0.70) are flagged in plans and reports.

## Candidate lifecycle

Local metadata tracks progression:

```text
GENERATED → CONFORMANCE_PASSED → SIMULATION_TESTED → HUMAN_REVIEWED → HARDWARE_TESTED
```

Sprint 4 modules start at `GENERATED` only. No centralized certification infrastructure exists yet.

## What generation does not do

- Auto-install modules
- Auto-register devices
- Open serial/TCP connections to hardware
- Flash firmware
- Execute generated wire-protocol code against real machines
- Reverse-engineer arbitrary binaries
- Claim "verified" or "certified" status

## Operator checklist

Before running generated code against hardware:

- [ ] Verify transport (serial/TCP/SDK) against vendor documentation
- [ ] Verify capability semantics and units
- [ ] Verify safety constraints with primary sources
- [ ] Verify simulator behavior matches expected state model
- [ ] Run targeted hardware tests in a controlled environment
- [ ] Install only after review: `pinout module install <path>`

## Reporting issues

If the generator produces a confident safety constraint without evidence, treat it as a bug. False confident claims around physical limits are more dangerous than missed capabilities.
