## [Unreleased]

### Added (Phases 1–5 sprint)

- **MCP Stdio Lifecycle & Governance Fix** (`packages/mcp`): Repaired process lifecycle in `runStdio.ts` so the stdio transport maintains session lifetime across sequential calls, exits cleanly on stdin EOF and `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`, and returns structured `DAEMON_UNAVAILABLE` errors without transport crashes when `pinoutd` is offline.
- **Control Plane Governance Alignment**: Standardized daemon URL environment variables (`PINOUT_DAEMON_URL` with fallback to `PINOUT_URL`) and `PINOUT_OWNER` across CLI, MCP, and Python SDK; documented intentional direct `@pinout/core` SDK bypass semantics in [ADR 0006](docs/adr/0006-daemon-governance-and-direct-access.md) and [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).
- **Protocol v1 Safety Additions**:
  - Negotiated deadman command watchdog (`watchdog.configure`, `watchdog.kick`) with autonomous microcontroller timeout tripping.
  - Circuit-aware per-output safe-state configuration (`gpio.configSafeState`) specifying fail-safe levels (`low`, `high`, `high-z`, `hold`) and load polarity (`active-high`, `active-low`).
  - Bounded command validity (`validityMs` TTL / `COMMAND_EXPIRED`).
  - Strict 1024-byte protocol line limit unified across firmware and host line readers.
  - New structured error codes: `NOT_ARMED`, `WATCHDOG_TRIPPED`, `WATCHDOG_NOT_SUPPORTED`, `COMMAND_EXPIRED`, `UNSUPPORTED_CONFIGURATION`, `LINE_TOO_LONG`, `FRAME_MISSING`, `TRANSFORM_STALE`.
- **Governed Arming State Machine & CLI Commands**:
  - Enforced explicit arming gate (`sys.arm` / `sys.disarm`): devices initialize disarmed at boot, reconnect, or reset; actuation while disarmed/tripped is strictly rejected.
  - Added daemon-routed `pinout arm <deviceId>` and `pinout disarm <deviceId>` CLI commands with timeout options.
  - `autoArm` option in simulator backends defaults to `false` and is strictly scoped to demo/testing with logged runtime warnings.
- **Commissioned Lamp Module (`pinout/lamp`)**:
  - First-party semantic actuator module exposing `lamp.arm`, `lamp.disarm`, `lamp.on`, `lamp.off`, `lamp.set`, and `lamp.status` without exposing raw GPIOs to agents.
  - Built-in `Esp32LampBackend` and in-process `SimulatedLampBackend` with shared conformance suite `runLampConformance()`.
- **Modbus Lamp Backend (`@pinout/protocols-modbus`, SIMULATED)**:
  - Second physical backend implementing the semantic lamp contract over Modbus TCP/RTU coils with independent discrete input readback.
  - Passes shared `runLampConformance()` suite against `SimulatedModbusServer`.
- **Evidence-Qualified State & Prerequisite Enforcement**:
  - Multi-stage state contract (`commanded`, `acknowledged`, `observed`, `freshnessMs`, `stale`, `provenance`) in `packages/core/src/spec/evidence.ts`.
  - The "Honesty Rule": write operations record `commanded` and `acknowledged` without inferring `observed` physical effect unless independently sensed.
  - Action prerequisite gating: rejects invocation prior to actuation when required state prerequisites are missing or stale.
  - Exposed via `/v1/devices/:id/state`, SSE event stream envelopes, MCP `pinout__describe_device`/`pinout__read_state`, and Python SDK.
- **Recovery & Mandatory Reconciliation Model**:
  - Hardened operation lifecycle across crash windows: Window A (pre-dispatch → `aborted`), Window B (dispatched/unacked → `requires_reconciliation`), Window C (completed → restored intact).
  - Explicit reconciliation endpoint `POST /v1/operations/:id/reconcile` and SDK `reconcile()` supporting `observedComplete`, `observedNotDone`, and `abandoned` ([ADR 0007](docs/adr/0007-reconciliation-required-for-uncertain-operations.md)).
  - Distinguishes cooperative cancellation requested (`cancelling`) from confirmed stop (`cancelled`/`stopped`) and unconfirmed stop (`stop_unconfirmed`).
  - Volatile lease clearing across daemon restart to prevent stale sessions from resuming actuation.
- **Doctor Diagnostic Workflow & Setup Guide**:
  - Added non-actuating `pinout doctor` command (`packages/cli/src/doctor/`) diagnosing environment, daemon, configuration, ports, and firmware identity.
  - Added step-by-step setup guide ([docs/setup.md](docs/setup.md)) with a 15-minute second-tester target and reference circuit breadboard guide ([hardware/reference/esp32-classic-led-sensor.md](hardware/reference/esp32-classic-led-sensor.md)).
- **ROS 2 Sidecar Boundary (`@pinout/ros2-sidecar`, SIMULATED)**:
  - Narrow sidecar module mapping single bounded Cartesian manipulation action (`arm.move_to_pose`) and stop (`arm.stop`) into Pinout runtime ([ADR 0008](docs/adr/0008-ros2-sidecar-boundary.md)).
  - Minimal `RosActionTransport` abstraction and `FakeRosActionServer`.
  - Frame tree validation (`FRAME_MISSING`) and transform freshness gating (`TRANSFORM_STALE`).
  - High-rate feedback isolation to `StreamBus` (`ros2-arm:feedback`), keeping high-rate streams off MCP and operation journals.
  - Controller loss mid-motion surfaces as `requires_reconciliation`.
  - In-process benchmark suite (`packages/ros2-sidecar/tests/benchmark.test.ts`) validating declared task limits (overhead p99 <= 15 ms, stop response p99 <= 30 ms).
- **Acceptance Ledger**: Comprehensive verification status matrix across all Phases 1–5 acceptance criteria in [docs/acceptance-ledger.md](docs/acceptance-ledger.md).

### Breaking Changes (Phases 1–5 sprint)

- **Explicit Arming Required for Actuation**: Calling actuation capabilities (`gpio.write`, `gpio.toggle`, `gpio.pulse`, `gpio.pwm`, `gpio.servo`, `gpio.motor`, `lamp.on`, etc.) on un-armed devices is now rejected with `NOT_ARMED` or `WATCHDOG_TRIPPED`. Callers must explicitly issue `sys.arm` or `lamp.arm` before actuating.

### Added (platform v1 sprint)

- **Spec v1 layer** (`packages/core/src/spec`): canonical versioned contracts — device identity/health/descriptors, capability kinds with danger levels and units, operations, leases, frames/poses, safety constraints with provenance, module manifest shape, support statuses. Deterministic unit conversions that refuse ambiguous conversions. Documented under `docs/spec/`.
- **Long-running operations** (`OperationManager`): queued/running/completed/failed/cancelled/timed_out/rejected lifecycle, idempotency keys that permanently dedupe client retries, deadlines, cooperative cancellation that only reports cancelled when the run acknowledges it, progress reporting with per-operation snapshots and `AsyncIterable` streams.
- **Resource leases** (`LeaseManager`): exclusive and shared-read modes, device- and capability-scoped leases, TTL/renew/release/expiry so crashed agents cannot hold hardware.
- **Safety engine v2** (`SafetyEngine`): rate, interlock, sequence, approval, lease, deadman, and resource-budget policies on top of the legacy range/state/workspace rules, with structured `SAFETY_*` codes and `mergeModuleAndDeploymentRules` that only lets deployments tighten module baselines (widening/contradictions become conflicts for human review).
- **Halt/E-stop coordinator** (`HaltCoordinator`): `NORMAL | RESTRICTED | HALTED | ESTOP_REQUESTED | FAULTED` with sticky estop (clear then resume), audited state transitions, and honest non-certification documentation.
- **DeviceGraph**: composition with parent/child links, cycle rejection, dotted addressing across vendors (`robot-cell-01.arm.motion.move_to`), and queries by class/capability/module/tag/parent/simulation.
- **Control journal** (`Journal`): append-only record of invocations, policy rejections, operations, faults, safety transitions, and lease activity; secret-shaped keys redacted, oversized payloads truncated; memory + JSONL storage, replay loading, and sequence hydration after restart.
- **Stream bus** (`StreamBus`): data-plane frame fan-out with `drop-oldest` / `drop-latest` / `latest-only` backpressure, snapshots, stream registration and close semantics.
- **`pinoutd` daemon** (`packages/daemon`): loopback-only local execution service with HTTP API (devices, invoke with dry-run and idempotency, operations, leases, halt/estop, SSE events, stream metadata, journal), bearer-token auth, refusal to bind non-loopback without explicit remote opt-in plus token.
- **Python SDK** (`sdk/python`): stdlib-only sync client plus asyncio client (httpx extra) with typed errors, operations with progress/cancel, leases, safety controls, SSE event streams; tested against an in-process mock daemon.
- **Modbus adapter** (`packages/protocols-modbus`): zero-dependency Modbus TCP (MBAP) and RTU (CRC16) clients, exception mapping to stable codes, and declarative register maps where unknown/read-only registers never become writable.
- **SCPI layer** (`packages/protocols-scpi`): SCPI parser with mnemonic abbreviation and channel syntax, sequential-queue client over any transport with error-queue draining, and reference instrument classes (power supply, DMM, function generator, conservative oscilloscope) with an explicit-opt-in raw escape hatch.
- **UDP and WebSocket transports** in core, with datagram exchange, idle close, reconnect with exponential backoff (never on explicit close), and structured logging.
- **MicroPython bridge** (`firmware/micropython-bridge`): board-agnostic NDJSON bridge with runtime capability detection, software pin-state shadow, UART (hardware) and stdio (host) modes, host-side protocol validation (`validate.js`), and a data-driven board descriptor.
- **CLI daemon commands**: `daemon status`, `halt`, `resume`, `estop`, `estop-clear`, `lease acquire/list/release`, `operations`, `logs`, plus a global `--url` flag talking to `pinoutd`.
- **Protocol-neutral tool export** (`runtimeToToolDefinitions`): every capability as a tool definition with derived danger classification for any AI vendor's function-call format.
- **Runtime integration**: `DeviceInstance.invoke` now runs the halt gate, v2 safety rules, and lease checks, and supports `dryRun` and `owner` options.
- **CI**: OS (Linux/macOS/Windows) × Node (20/22) matrix, Python SDK job (3.10/3.12), and MicroPython bridge protocol validation.
- Spec docs live in `docs/spec/`; the daemon guide is `docs/daemon.md`.
